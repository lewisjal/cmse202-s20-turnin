    "1. Navigate to your `cmse202-s20-turnin` repository and create a new directory called `hw-01`.\n",
    "2. Move this notebook into that **new directory** in your repository, then **add it and commit it to your repository**.\n",

    "\n",
    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account in the \"`cmse202-s20-turnin`\" repository inside the `hw-01` directory that you just created.  Periodically, **you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location**. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish.  It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit."
